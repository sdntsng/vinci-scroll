## Current Inworld AI Integration Analysis

### Genuinely Applicable Inworld Features:
1. **Character-based Guidance**: AI characters providing contextual help during video evaluation tasks
2. **Conversational Feedback**: Natural language interactions for collecting detailed user feedback
3. **Dynamic Challenge Presentation**: AI characters explaining complex evaluation tasks
4. **Personalized Coaching**: Adaptive guidance based on user performance

### Features NOT Currently Applicable:
1. **3D Avatar Integration**: Not needed for video evaluation interface
